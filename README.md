# Hackathon Projects
## Hackathons: What are they?
Hackathons are events in which a number of people meet to engage in collaborative programming, network with others, and win prizes! During hackathons, participants can work with other hackers or create projects by themselves. Hackathons usually have various tracks or subjects that projects can be submitted to and win prizes for, as well as overall (top 10, 5, 3, etc.) winners. I began participating in hackathons in June of 2021.

## Pivot from Palm
### ðŸ¤” What is it?
A website I made with a team of two other hackers. We coded this website with `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript`. Pivot from Palm is a website that encourages site visitors to think about the impacts the palm oil industry has on the environment and endangered animals, such as orangutans. My team (Orangutan Synergy) completed this project over the course of two days, submitted it to Sego Lily Hacks, and won the Best Environmental Hack prize! <br>
